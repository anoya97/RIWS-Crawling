Flavours variously embrace citrus fruits, mangoes, peaches, figs, and chestnuts as the seasons change. Each course offers variations in fragrance, texture and temperature, and through the incorporation of vegetables. The chef was born in Yamanashi Prefecture in the imposing presence of Mt. Fuji, hence the name of the establishment (yama means ‘mountain’). Yama demonstrates that, like the rugged Japanese islands so rich in peaks and valleys, pure sweetness can take a wide variety of forms.",

Destiny is in the taste and texture of every piece of sushi at Harutaka.",

Hand-made soba is served in a chilled broth as an amuse-bouche. Vegetables, fruits and mushrooms raised by his parents in Yamagata are used in appetisers and sweet dishes. This cuisine is supported by the ingredients of Onuma’s birthplace and the bonds of family.",

But the chef does not stop there and keeps innovating. He showcases his creativity in the preparation of his garnishes. The diversity of textures, the interplay of hot and cold, the vibrancy of subtle acidity... With such finesse, he creates depth of flavour. He has a preference for fish, although the lamb loin in a sea salt crust is one of the house classics. The delightful hostess's exquisite wine pairings perfectly complement the food.

    "description": "Creativity doesn't have to be synonymous with showmanship. Diners need not expect outlandish combinations or countless processes from Hans Derks. His ingenuity lies in striking a balance between a limited number of ingredients. Think fresh langoustine tartare served with a ponzu dressing, dots of miso mayonnaise for that subtle fermented note, and the crispness of sliced radish and green apple. It may sound simple, but this approach demonstrates his technical skill and knowledge of flavours. Chef Derks likes to dabble in the flamboyance of Mediterranean cooking and the intensity of Asian cuisine, and dares, for example, to give tournedos Rossini a modern twist. He chooses his (often local) suppliers carefully and focuses on his sauces, eschewing unnecessary frills in favour of distinct and multifaceted flavours. In this former butcher's shop, with its trendy, pared-down vibe, diners can enjoy an experience that showcases understated creativity and Brabantian hospitality.",

Housed in De L'Europe hotel, this upscale restaurant is lent a unique feel by its modern interior design, which features natural materials. Bas van Kranen's original approach to nature, which characterises his cuisine, emphasises vegetables, local produce and sustainability. Biodynamic growers have become regular suppliers and dairy products have been banished from the kitchen. His search for solutions feeds his creativity, and has resulted in a very pure style of cooking. Game appears on the menu in the autumn and winter, but in spring and summer, the chef turns his attention to the North Sea. The plant-based set menu is a constant, all year round. The small dishes are full of surprises right up to the last bite – a prime example is his signature dish featuring seasonal fruits and vegetables, each prepared differently. The intricate dance of flavours and textures is complemented by a fig peel oil, its gentle sweetness binding everything together. A light, airy hazelnut and Dutch wasabi emulsion adds a moderate kick. Bas van Kranen explores the depths of his ingredients, creating dishes that evoke emotion. He clearly takes pride in working with Dutch produce and now has the confidence to cook just the way he wants to.",

This chef champions a minimalist cooking style, creating unfussy dishes by preparing the finest ingredients in time-honoured tradition. Think grilled lobster tail with green apple, razor clam mousse, deep-fried soft shell crab and an exquisite fennel broth-based sauce. Innovative flourishes keep his cuisine captivating, exemplified by a dessert featuring pancakes with a subtly sweetened sour cream ice cream, caviar and nut cakes.

Indeed, respect for the produce, which is often locally sourced, is at the heart of everything they do here. He has a knack for combining unexpected flavours and exotic seasonings, always striking the perfect balance. For instance, he transforms Wagyu beef into a marbled terrine, giving it a quick crust – the result is incredibly rich and butter-soft. To accompany this, he serves a green pepper sauce, perfectly balanced with the yuzu's citrus notes, which cuts through the richness of the dish – a testament to his expertise.

This is paired with a subtly sweetened mole, its characteristic nuttiness and spice adding another dimension. Pea and asparagus garnishes lend a burst of freshness and playfulness.

    "description": "Emile van der Staak's vision comes to life in this urban restaurant, where you can see the impressive team at work in the open kitchen. His botanical gastronomy showcases the \"age of plants'' at this MICHELIN Green Star restaurant that is taking a stand against climate change. He is a visionary writing a story, with every chapter whetting your appetite. Emile van der Staak's source of inspiration is Food Forest Ketelbroek. This is where he makes discoveries, reflects and creates — and his is a creative spirit that seems to know no bounds. He has developed a precise technique of bringing the microseasons to life in his set menu, which changes three times a year. Take, for example, his dish based on SCOBY, the biofilm that develops on kombucha during the fermentation process. The chef slices the pellicle into thin strips, allowing its umami essence, akin to the taste of shrimp, to shine through. Pickled radish, ginger and a mushroom and onion sauce – spicy, sweet and subtly tangy – add an extra kick. Sichuan pickled pepper and a rich walnut milk elevate the whole dish. Talk about innovation! This is cuisine that takes familiar flavours to the next level. The heavenly \"no-chocolate\" dessert with roasted Alkmaar groats, and the almond-based \"Brie\" are mind-blowing. A groundbreaking experience.",

No doubt Wils would have been proud of this American-style urban brasserie, which feels both grand and intimate. The cocktail bar is certainly on trend, and in summer you can dine on the roof terrace. The cuisine never fails to impress – especially its use of fire. A charcoal grill, traditional ovens… Here, they cook with brute force. But rest assured: with chef Joris Bijdendijk and team, you are in safe hands. For instance, they combine charcoal-grilled porcini with a smoked einkorn wheat and mushroom cream, elevating those spicy, earthy flavours with an airy fermented asparagus foam that adds a touch of vibrancy. Raw button mushrooms add a delightful crunch to finish the dish. Bold flavours are given extra depth with a sure hand. The chefs have a penchant for plant-based cuisine and enjoy playing around with spices and contrasts. Guaranteed to whet the appetite!",

This comes through, for example, in the lobster cream sauce, full bodied and rich, which takes his well-known combination of bream chicken and langoustine ravioli to the next level. At Parkheuvel, it is the sauces that really blow diners away. His son Juliën's input adds detail and diversity in the preparation of the dishes as he brings his youthful energy to the table. For instance, he combines foie gras with sweet-and-sour pickled beetroot, a Pinot Grigio and dark chocolate jelly, as well as apple and sesame garnishes for added playfulness.

Having spent years here as a sous-chef, honing his classic culinary skills, he now charts his own course, without breaking with the house style: premium-quality ingredients and rich sauces are still the name of the game. For instance, he braises veal sweetbreads, coats them in miso breadcrumbs, glazes them with an XO sauce made from fermented mushrooms and adds a drizzle of sambai and a lemon foam. A burst of freshness is provided by accoutrements such as sweet-and-sour onion, giving a perfect finishing touch to this minimalist dish. And it would be remiss not to mention the incredibly intense sauce made from Anjou pigeon cooking juices, delicately infused with cocoa and cherries. Chef Van der Zalm is a master saucier who combines a playful approach to international influences, bold innovation and a respect for tradition in his highly personal creations. A unique experience awaits you in what was once the bakery of this 18C Roman Catholic almshouse, whose original wood and stone have been incorporated into a modern interior.",

This is creative cuisine that packs a punch, but for all the complexity of its flavours, it is very easy to enjoy – just take a look at all the happy faces around you. The chef likes to come to the table to present his signature celeriac dish. You might want to congratulate him on his fabulous creation: He imbues thin slices of celeriac with smoke on the barbecue and combines them with a celeriac cream, a perfectly runny egg and a robust hollandaise sauce. A creamy garlic sauce provides the necessary finesse, shavings of black truffle add their distinctive fragrance.

    "description": "'t Ganzenest will forever be associated with Harry Visbeen, who held a MICHELIN star for many years. Today, Erik Tas is writing a new chapter of this beautiful story. He has cultivated the authentic allure of the building and revamped the restaurant with just the right dose of elegance. A glance at the menu reveals that chef Tas is a fan and connoisseur of top-quality produce such as turbot, veal sweetbreads and wagyu. He enhances these ingredients with the perfect garnishes and expertly done sauces with great depth of flavour. Take, for example, the wonderful cream sauce with chanterelles and the rich veal jus that elevates a fillet of turbot to new heights. He showcases strawberries, for instance, in a beautifully airy soufflé, but also subtly macerated with a ball of super creamy vanilla ice cream and in an elaborate creation with a strawberry coulis brightened with a dash of vinegar. Erik Tas is an astute chef who knows how to get the best out of his ingredients, and understands that less is more. The produce is clearly the star of the show here – the enthusiasm with which the waitstaff present the wines and cheeses is infectious.",

    "description": "From the moment the exquisite amuse-bouches are served, Cas Pikaar's talent is plain to see. This young chef fuses classic craftsmanship with unbridled creativity – he even won our Young Chef Award in 2020. The chef's jacket he received then is still on display in his inviting, chic restaurant: a place where originality and youthful enthusiasm converge. Chef Pikaar's culinary skill is beyond question; his Anjou pigeon, for instance, is cooked to perfection. The slices of meat melt in the mouth, the confit legs and the heart are deliciously intense, the creaminess of the liver is full of depth – a true labour of love! He is more playful with the garnishes, with a variety of vinaigrettes and expertly balanced spices. He also likes to put his own spin on classics such as tournedos Rossini, for example, by subtly seasoning the robust Madeira sauce with five-spice powder. The main ingredient is put on a pedestal, thanks to the whirlwind of nuances that surround it. In the chef's own words, he likes to look for contrasts, but never goes out of his way – and in doing so, he demonstrates just how talented he is.",

Jonnie and Thérèse Boer have built up a kitchen team that loves working with produce from Zwolle, often cooks on the wood fire and manages to create dishes that are original but not overly complex. Our inspectors were bowled over by a combination of wonderfully crispy veal sweetbreads with a subtly sweet glaze, both raw and deep-fried shrimps, crunchy vegetable accoutrements and an exquisite peanut sauce that elevated the entire dish, enhancing the complex flavour nuances. At Brass Boer Thuis, the chefs are not afraid to use bold flavours, but they always manage to strike the right balance. As a result, the extensive menu is full of mouthwatering options.

    "description": ", both a Mexican flower and the Greek word for \"beauty\", perfectly captures the serene feel of this elegant restaurant. In both the champagne lounge and the dining room, the decor is stylish, with decorative flowers adding a touch of warmth. Ronald van Roon puts great emphasis on vegetables in his dishes, picking up a fresh supply from Laantje Voorham vegetable garden every day. The meticulous chef likes to combine his harvest with other top-notch ingredients that he prepares as simply as possible to let their natural flavours shine through. He is unwavering when it comes to his cooking methods and choice of produce; it is the garnishes that bring variety. When the vegetable garden is at its most productive, he celebrates that abundance, for example, with a signature dish. Our inspectors were delighted by the combination of confit yellow beetroot, crunchy peas, red meat radishes, various herbs from the garden and a wonderful leek oil-based hollandaise sauce to underscore this tribute to the season. Calla's promises a memorable dining experience that is both understated and sophisticated.",

Chef Bahadoer gives European dishes a twist by drawing on influences from Suriname, India and Indonesia. His creations are spicy and exceptionally captivating. The flavour profiles are occasionally complex but always balanced, and his seasoning is spot on. He imparts intense, spicy nuances to premium ingredients such as foie gras and pigeon. Think perfectly cooked langoustine glazed with Wagyu fat and dusted with a blend of paprika and tomato. The dish is finished with the crisp textures of green apple and a fiery kick of turmeric – sensational!

Dining in this splendid historical manor house, overlooking the stunning grounds and ponds, is an extraordinary experience. The soothing music and understated modern design perfectly complement this gorgeous setting. The chefs contrast the peaceful ambiance with their pronounced, often daring flavours. They add zing to their creative combinations with bursts of acidity and sophisticated garnishes. They elevate the medium-rare pigeon fillet, for instance, with the sweet and bitter interplay of beetroot cream, lovage oil, ripe sweet cherries and velvety mousseline. The sauces are a key element of their dishes, and they strive to reduce them to their most essential form. The modern sophistication of their beautifully presented creations is captivating. The chefs draw inspiration from their natural surroundings, as well as produce from local suppliers and their own herb garden. And why not cap off your culinary adventure with a memorable night's stay at Parc Broekhuizen?",

Perfectly fried on the skin, red mullet is combined with braised lacinato kale and fennel, fennel foam and his take on the Catalan suquet fish soup, à la bouillabaisse, with crispy prawn. This is a dish with spirit! His quest for novelty is captivating, as seen in his delectable dessert featuring a unique combination of mushrooms and chicory. Both Zarzo's wine list (with more than 2 000 labels!) and sommelier happen to be among the best in the country. Although the selection includes some excellent wines from around the globe, it is Spanish gems that are given pride of place. This is wine pairing par excellence!",

The minimalist interior has been specifically designed as a setting in which guests can enjoy Texel's bounty of produce – the local suckling lamb is world famous and, needless to say, also a firm fixture here. But Jef Schuur draws much more from his surroundings. Salty herbs, crustaceans and shellfish… the list goes on. Chef Schuur puts his terroir first – be sure to take a look around the impressive vegetable garden behind the restaurant – and he showcases it elegantly in contemporary-style dishes. His innovative creations often feature invigorating sweet and sour nuances. This is a chef who likes to surprise. Sauces are key: think a rich lamb jus and herb-infused oil to pair with crispy slow-roasted lamb neck. The refreshing flavours of Texel are paired with some real gems from the world of wine, selected by maître d' Nadine, for example the delicate Madeira Rainwater Reserva that brings out all the flavours of the subtle dessert based on blood orange. Divine! You'll also be hard pressed to resist the trolley of pastries to go with your coffee. And as a cosy finale to this wonderful experience, you should definitely consider booking one of the designer guestrooms.",

Chef Danny's cooking style fuses tradition with creativity. Sweet, sour, zesty and umami flavours are precisely balanced in subtle combinations. He creates exciting dishes in which exotic seasonings meet French techniques for an extra layer of sophistication. East and West become one here. The chef's expertise is evident in his house-made gochujang, his Sichuan chilli sauce, the crispy fried shallot and the star anise and five-spice-flavoured cooking juices that accompany his Peking-style barbary duck. His daughter Monica's expertly chosen wine pairings elevate this delightful dining experience (the wine room itself is a sight to behold). The premium tea selection serves as an equally ideal accompaniment, allowing the subtle nuances of the dishes to truly shine. The Tsang family are proud ambassadors of Asia's culinary richness.",

Chef Corpel takes inspiration from techniques and ingredients from all over the world, while resolutely forging his own culinary path. His meticulously crafted dishes draw on local produce, enhanced here and there by exotic touches, to showcase his love for the North Sea and the intensity of classic sauces. Turbot fried in beurre noisette, for example, is given a lift by infusing the beurre blanc with dashi and incorporating drops of herb oil. Pieces of lobster tail and flash-grilled green asparagus round out the meal. At De Moerbei, the purity of the flavours takes centre stage, leaving a lasting impression on every diner.",

The depth of flavour of his main ingredient is enhanced by his intense sauces. His refined technique is evident in every dish, his playful garnishes providing refreshing contrasts. For example, he elevates lobster with a blend of salty herbs, a carrot puree with a bright orange flavour, a rich lobster bisque infused with coral, a zesty lemongrass emulsion, and a dashi-infused jus for a Far Eastern twist. This chef is constantly evolving, seeking new ways to express his culinary creativity. The attention to aesthetic detail extends to the dining space. The moment you arrive in the charming village of Zuidlaren, you will be won over by the elegance and homely feel of this historical Saxon farmhouse (1719 ).

One can't help but be won over by the Italian marble, the blend of modern and vintage design elements, the large glass windows, the charming courtyard and the chic bar serving delicious snacks and cocktails. Then there's the impressive wine list, featuring both established classics and exciting new finds. Michael Verhagen likes to give those great wines a run for their money by juxtaposing them with modern French cuisine. The sauces showcase his classical culinary knowhow, and he builds his dishes on this foundation. For example, he serves Anjou pigeon, roasted on the bone and seasoned with vadouvan, its rump succulently braised, a velvety pumpkin purée and a rich lentil dhal that perfectly complements the robust flavour of the pigeon and the earthy sweetness of the lentils. A real treat! The subtlety of his approach and the exciting interplay of flavours and textures are testament to his skill as a chef. Fitzgerald has style!",

Spetters enjoys a prime location between the fish market and Breskens marina – and produce enthusiast Laurent Smallegange could not be happier as he showcases Zeeland's rich bounty, from Eastern Scheldt lobster to Sluis lamb. His cooking style is both creative and unassuming. The dishes are brought to life by international influences and zingy flavours, and the innovative preparation techniques are truly stimulating. Each creation is carefully conceived. He pairs succulent pan-fried sea bass, for example, with the earthiness of chanterelles in a creamy sauce in which the mushroom beautifully complements the richness of a poultry stock. The chef's signature dish, a combination of sweetbreads and Eastern Scheldt eel, is a testament to his culinary skill. No frills, just an abundance of sparkling flavours.

With their inventiveness and classical know-how (those sauces!), both chefs put their own stamp on their creations. An ingredient will undergo the most surprising of transformations, and it all seems to happen with such ease – therein lies the chefs' originality. The venison cooked in hay, for instance, is elevated by a perfectly reduced, intensely flavoursome sauce with a glistening sheen. A padrón pepper in tempura and an ingenious association of plum and Meaux mustard provide fine spiciness and extra dimensions. The simplicity of this cuisine is what makes it so ingenious! Nothing is overdone, and nothing is lacking. The real stars of this show are the extraordinary produce and the talent of two friends.",

The synergy between them is palpable – in the impeccable service, the lounge-like ambiance of this elegant open-plan restaurant, and especially in the way everything complements the food on your plate. Chef Floris effortlessly experiments with seasonings from around the globe and refreshing nuances. His intricate sauces showcase his exceptional technique. He artfully combines perfectly seared langoustines with Jerusalem artichoke, an intense bisque enriched with espresso and curry oil for just the right amount of heat. A symphony of flavours!",

With a generous and refined touch, Chef Van der Kroft puts a unique and generous spin on familiar flavours. When it's time for coffee, for instance, the chef delivers a warm pastel de nata and comes to the table with a pot of chocolate mousse and a wooden spoon.

A prime example is his pan-seared red mullet, with its crispy skin and juicy flesh, which he pairs with wonderfully briny mussels with layers of lardo di Colonnata. A barigoule sauce and an espuma with baharat seasoning add that extra depth and a burst of freshness. The smoky notes of barbecued pineapple are offset by the subtle bite of ginger, umeboshi and a beautiful quenelle of chai ice cream. Chef Kinkartz is known for his love of Asian flavours, which give his dishes that extra dimension. With creative abandon, this experienced craftsman gives classic cooking techniques a fresh, modern twist. Each and every dinner in this historical half-timbered house, with its elegant symbiosis of contemporary design and industrial austerity, comes with its own surprises.

Sustainable regional produce, a focus on vegetables, inventive techniques, the use of fermentation for freshness and acidity. These terms are commonplace today, and that is partly thanks to chef Boer. He incorporates them into his very personal take on cuisine, which abounds with expressive flavours and memorable dishes. Pike-perch from the IJsselmeer, for example, is cooked until perfectly succulent, glazed with apple syrup that is not overly sweet, and topped with zolderspek (cured \"attic bacon\") that has been smoked in-house. A few well-thought-out vegetable garnishes and a beurre blanc made with Riesling round off this ode to the Dutch terroir. Diners tuck into their food in the extraordinary setting: the glass-covered courtyard of a former prison. Every detail hits the right note. From the tour of the kitchen with Jonnie to the private dining experience that completely immerses guests in the world of De Librije.

There are also luxurious guestrooms for a relaxing stay.

When he incorporates international influences and creative ideas, he never goes overboard and tends to stick to classic flavours. The quality of the produce is impressively showcased, and his dishes are presented in such a way that you can see exactly what you're eating. For example, he cooks top-quality langoustine to a turn and elevates it with a sauce with a hint of caper, then, for a burst of freshness, he adds fragrant vegetables such as broad beans from his own garden and camomile flowers. This is a wonderfully simple take on refined cuisine! What a pleasure it is to be spoiled by Martin Kruithof.",

It was there that he learned, for example, to cook perfectly crispy sweetbreads. His flawless technique is highlighted by his own unique style. For example, he gives perfectly pan-seared cod an exciting twist with various textures of cauliflower and grey prawn. A jus made from the bones is then rounded out by incorporating a sherry cream emulsion – that’s efficiency that packs a punch! Chef Van Santvoort likes to add a vibrant kick of acidity to his dishes and deftly plays with sweet undertones. This elevates top-quality ingredients like turbot and langoustine to a whole new level. The sommelier cleverly plays on this with exciting wine pairings. Your journey to Flicka will be rewarded with views of the green surroundings and the River Meuse. The cosy decor also incorporates some charming designer touches. Last but not least, delightful suites are available for overnight stays.",

Diners are led through the different spaces, from the aperitif lounge to the cosy salon to the kitchen itself. The place has the feel of a luxurious chalet; the upscale modern design is extraordinary. This is art rather than architecture! Hans van Wolde takes you into his world, where you momentarily lose track of time. It is certainly worth considering the wonderful accommodation options in the lodges and mansion. But back to the food, which is made with top-quality ingredients and features deep, complex sauces. Hans van Wolde's culinary creations are playful and expressive, just like his character. Succulent pan-seared fillets of North Sea sole, for instance, take centre stage in a dish that combines the earthy flavours of chopped chanterelles and black truffle, an exquisite sweet red wine reduction, mustard mousseline and a pomme soufflé. Terroir and craftsmanship come together, resulting in a cuisine that creates diverse impressions, ranging from the adventurous to the familiar. Then there is the obliging front-of-house team and selection of wines from around the globe, as well as a range of delicious juices for alcohol-free pairing… Brut172 is waiting to be discovered!",

    "description": "Striving for nothing less than perfection, François Geurds has created a trendy urban restaurant that is immediately captivating. With luxurious porcelain custom-made for specific dishes, and an impressive collection of knives and trolleys… At FG, they do not shy away from the spectacular. The private dining room even features an upside-down garden! Chef Geurds loves working with premium ingredients such as Wagyu A5 and lobster, but sometimes he also lets celeriac take centre stage. His dishes are thought-provoking and characterised by meticulous attention to detail and original ideas. His sauces are wonderfully complex. For example, he boldly combines fermented banana with seared avocado, salty caviar and a fantastic beurre blanc made with caviar's own fat. This is a technically adept chef who likes to test boundaries, always maintaining a sense of balance. His innovations are compelling. Cap off your meal with a rich coffee from the barista, and treat yourself to something from the impressive dessert trolley. At FG, nothing is left to chance.",

What he does not grow himself, he sources as locally as possible. His creativity is inspired by the richness of his terroir. He accompanies Geuldal suckling lamb neck he not only with a rich lamb jus, but also a zingy yoghurt dressing with mint oil and crisp vegetable accoutrements.

But the team persevered and today are a standard-bearer of the MICHELIN Green Star. They grow about 300 varieties of vegetables, herbs and fruit both on site and in their larger field in the Beemster Polder. What is harvested in the morning from the imposing greenhouse will take pride of place on the plate a little later, in light, modern creations. Tip: make a beeline for the fabulous garden terrace. Wim de Beer and Jos Timmer are masters in the art of delicately balancing sweet and sour flavours. Subtle sauces highlight the creative vegetable dishes (sometimes with meat or fish). For example, a soft saffron cream elevates the smoky flavour of barbecued pointed cabbage, and the briny freshness of cockles is accentuated by a lime leaf emulsion. The wealth of natural produce that these chefs have at their disposal is a constant source of inspiration for their seemingly boundless creativity, and that is what foodies really revel in.",

To provide further complexity, he incorporates a Mediterranean ratatouille and salty oyster leaf.

Potato foam, brown butter, and roe are clever pairings with Hokkaido scallop. Pasta is a highlight, like corn agnolotti with Manchego, but so too is the short rib.

Almost everything on this tight menu passes through the kitchen’s 26-foot-long wood-burning grill that actively roars and smokes. At the end of the line is a single chef at the earthenware comal, who prepares tortillas from heirloom corn that is nixtmalized and ground in-house. Lamb barbacoa packed into griddled, blue masa tortillas and charred maitake mushrooms set in a crema poblana highlight the transformative magic of fire, while dry-aged amberjack aguachile flexes the kitchen’s delicate side. Can’t decide? Servers are happy to build you a tasting menu. All the while, bartenders rise to the occasion with refined, agave-based cocktails in a narrow space that has all the coolness and vibrancy of Mexico City.",

A superbly light vitello tonnato and a piping hot Ligurian flatbread stuffed with stracchino offer promising starts. There must be pasta, like squid ink spaghetti with Nova Scotia lobster, and there must be panna cotta. A deep Italian wine list and an especially talented cocktail program round out an experience that is as accomplished as it is hospitable.",

No desserts are offered for the time being, so there’s no reason to leave any extra room.",

A cleanly minimalist new Nordic style is clearer than ever in an elegant tasting menu that deftly weaves together a variety of preserved fruits and vegetables, flawless seafood, and aged meats. Meals are off to an impressive start with the likes of a refreshing cured California trout dressed with a chilled fish bone broth drizzled with herbed oil. Rutabaga is transformed into thin, flat strands mimicking pasta and comes dressed with a creamy-textured smoked pork fat sauce. The applewood roasted quail features crisped-skin breast plated with a luscious jus and bouquet of Napa Valley greens, while the leg and thigh are glazed with fermented blueberry.",

From there, it's a seasonal celebration artistically arranged on vintage Japanese pottery and porcelain collected by the chef.

It’s there that the kitchen shines its brightest though, with such elaborate entrées as ricotta gnudi neatly arranged with chanterelles à la Grecque, tender squash and golden raisins. The popular key lime tart is an equally impressive display—its crisp and perfect shell topped with toasted marshmallows, viola petals and meringue batons.",

The little bites and dishes that precede the nigiri can often feel like a second thought at most counters, but that's far from the case here, where the omakase yields an impressive amount of food. His food is personal: the majority of the seafood comes from Toyosu; he uses Akitakomachi rice from his hometown of Iwate Prefecture; and all of the food is served on his handmade pottery. This meal is also original, fusing the style of cha-kaiseki with traditional omakase. Diners are treated to a parade of flavors ending with the richest, though tuna is clearly the star. Finish with matcha green tea and homemade sweets.",

Desserts never fail to end the meal on a strong note, as in a perfectly tender, moist apple crumb cake dressed up with an orange bay leaf ice cream and satsuma granita.",

His six-course tasting menu showcases a modern version of traditional Dalmatian cuisine, with interesting, creative touches and beautiful presentation. One of the house specialities is the pasta with duck, which features slow-cooked slices of duck breast accompanied by a creamy pecorino sauce, confit duck breast and slices of celery that add a fresh and acidic flavour – a traditional dish that has been skilfully reinterpreted. The interesting wine list has more than 500 different labels.",

    "description": "Situated in the lush Soča valley with magnificent mountains as a backdrop, “Franko’s house” boasts a beautiful, welcoming, simple yet elegant ambience from the moment you enter the small room near the entrance where guests can enjoy an aperitif before their meal. Very few cuisines reflect the personality of the chef like that of Ana Roš Stojan. Her strong, determined, extrovert and contagiously friendly character is perfectly mirrored on a long tasting menu, on which dishes have intensive and decisive flavours with no half measures. Each course is a true discovery, in which local and Slovenian ingredients and traditions are skilfully combined with influences from elsewhere in the world with grace, good taste and the chef’s own inimitable style. Following on from the “50 shades of Life” menu (dedicated to the chef’s age), this year’s menu is entitled “50 shades of Red”, a colour which symbolises all the hard work at Hiša Franko, from the red of passion to the cuisine and the service of the brilliant and well-trained young staff. The wine-pairing choices are excellent, with three different options: one based on more classic wines, another which allows guests to explore natural wines and highly individual labels, and a third non-alcoholic option featuring home-made drinks. Among the house specialities which are nearly always present on the menu, don’t miss the corn beignet with fermented cottage cheese and smoked trout roe, and the hay-baked potatoes with fenugreek and roasted yeast-infused sour cream – the latter is a very simple dish that offers an interesting take on a childhood favourite. Should you decide to spend the night here, the copious and highly colourful breakfast is equally recommended.",

Dishes change daily depending on market availability and always feature top-quality ingredients full of flavour, including vegetables from the restaurant’s own kitchen gardens and eggs and meat (in season) from their own ducks. Fish from the not-so-distant Upper Adriatic also makes an appearance, sourced from three trusted fishing boats. The choice of wines by the glass allows for truly original pairings, in which wine and food complement each other to perfection.

Tomaž Kavčič is one of the best-known chefs in Slovenia and his style perfectly represents the transition between traditional and modern cuisine. We recommend the 7-course menu – if you’re lucky, it will include the delicious radicchio with foie gras and pork rind chips, or the tender beef cheeks served with different vegetable-based sauces. The theatrical and iconic “gin and tonic” will also make a real impression. An enthusiastic sommelier will guide you through the interesting wine list, which has a strong focus on the Vipava valley. We recommend trying the wines from the Burja estate, one of the area’s most representative producers.",

When it comes to choosing wine, either speak with the sommelier or browse through the wine list which includes some excellent Slovenian options, as well as labels from further afield, some of which are available by the glass.

This is reflected in the Afetividade and Criatividade menus (with two and four main courses, respectively) which pay homage to the different regions of Brazil. The kitchen is situated upstairs, hence the almost constant and careful movement of trays up and down the stairs. What impressed us first and foremost was the creativity of the starters, including the superb oysters with jabuticaba, and the selection of appetisers to eat with your hands, some of which are crunchy, some Brazilian, and others inspired by Japanese cuisine.",

This attractive eatery, with its exotic feel and lots of greenery on display, features several dining rooms that lead to the main room with a counter around the open kitchen, which is the best place to eat while watching the chef in full flow. The à la carte has plenty of options, including a number of special dishes (Kinoshita uses exclusive ingredients such as scallops from Picinguaba and Yamaguishi organic eggs), although we can recommend the Omakase experience. We particularly enjoyed the squid with sea urchin.",

Options include brioche with wagyu tartare and Macadamia nuts, oysters with ponzu, and a superb array of sushi – through the latter the chef demonstrates his undeniable skill in front of our eyes (although some diners are happy to order just a single type of sushi).

    "description": "Part of the “Copa” (Copacabana Palace), the city’s most famous hotel thanks to its setting on the world’s most famous beach, the luxurious Cipriani restaurant combines the best of Italy and Brazil. Here, to a backdrop of highly attentive service, you are spoilt by the choice of two tasting menus (there’s also a vegan option) created by Italian chef Nello Cassese, who bases his dishes on Italian ingredients and expertly combines them with others sourced more locally. The end results are classic Neopolitan and Piedmontese specialities (such as fried pizza and vitello tonnato) with a contemporary feel alongside other more creative dishes (we were pleasantly surprised by the organic egg served with artichoke, 36-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and truffle). Enjoy views of the splendid swimming pool, discreetly illuminated at night, through the restaurant’s windows.",

It is slightly reminiscent of the more authentic restaurants found in Tokyo (with just a chef, a counter, a rice cooker and a chopping board) and could almost pass unnoticed if you’re not looking out for it. Working alone, chef Keisuke Egashira bases the dining experience on the quality of the ingredients (grouper, tuna belly, squid, red snapper, Japanese amberjack etc), preparing sushi and sashimi with impressive speed and technical skill. Here, every cut is precise and without showmanship or great spectacle, just the time-honoured skills of a true artist of Japanese cuisine.

The à la carte, teeming with nigiris, temakis, sashimi and dumplings, is complemented by interesting tasting menus (these include an Omakase option as well as a vegetarian menu).

But beyond the hustle and bustle, Chef Seijun Okano offers a mature, finely tuned omakase for the fortunate few seated at his counter. Fish flown in multiple times a week from Japan are handled with precision, sliced carefully and pressed into lush, vinegar-tinged rice that he makes at the start. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions and drink freely. All the while, the team works in perfect tandem, delivering a well-paced sushi experience to the tune of an upbeat playlist. In the end, diners emerge from the secret room wondering if those around them know what they’ve missed.",

Think shrimp from Cape Canaveral and soft, confit potatoes with chawanmushi or consider the dry-aged, grilled cobia served with a Moujean tea beurre blanc. It all comes to an end much too soon, and before long, you’re digging into a pumpkin flan that’s been churned into ice cream and topped with pepita granola and coffee espumita.",

Delicate sea bream wrapped around sprouts with shaved black truffle delivers dialed-in flavors, while tempura-fried kamasu, served with myoga and chilled, roasted sweet eggplant, is smart and spot on. After a handful of dishes from the kitchen, they progress into the nigiri.

In the open kitchen, Andreas Saul displays exceptional passion, precision, originality and creativity. He has some really innovative ways of working with produce from the region. A shining example is his \"Charcuterie von der Karotte\", for which carrot is coated with a fine mould, as you would usually find on salami. Fermentation, smoking, and purees are also frequently involved, and you'll even find Far Eastern specialities such as kimchi. The set menu is meticulously crafted down to the smallest detail and is brimming with unique flavours. High-end dining paired with a pleasingly down-to-earth atmosphere.",

Since 1980 he has been head chef in this restaurant that was opened by Armin and Emmi Scherrer in 1976 (and awarded one, and at times even two MICHELIN stars as of 1978). For years the outstanding regional, often organically certified produce has been par for the course here. As classic as the interior – the large-format erotic painting remains the decorative focus! – are also the dishes. The Holstein venison, served with an excellent rosemary sauce, for instance, is absolutely fantastic. The wine cellar, which has grown to over 10 000 bottles, is also impressive! The service is attentive and professional, but by no means stuffy. For an alternative to gourmet cuisine, head to Wehmann's Bistro for good regional dishes.",

The Riva Hotel and its fine dining restaurant may bowl visitors over with its location directly on the lakeside promenade, but it is above all Dirk Hoberg's meticulous cuisine that captures hearts. This gorgeous Art Nouveau villa dating from 1909 provides a stylish, modern and elegant setting in which to sample a tasting menu composed of a series of refined dishes, complete with sauces inspired by the classics of French cuisine. - the Château Chalon sauce, for example, is delicious! The excellent wine list is international in its scope. Look out for the chef - from time to time he brings out dishes himself. Tip: Book the \"kitchen table\" directly at the pass to the open kitchen.",

Coffee and cake are served here during the day, while in the evening the kitchen team, headed up by eponymous proprietor Malte Kuhn, proposes modern dishes – prepared in the \"hidden kitchen\" tucked away behind a sliding panel. They skilfully pare things down to the essentials, making the ingredients the focus of the 3- to 6-course menu, from which you can also choose à la carte. In addition to the wine pairing, there is also a non-alcoholic beverage pairing based on the teas from the coffee shop. The service is extremely friendly and professional, with the cooks also getting in on the act and the owner always on hand, too. A pleasant, cosy little restaurant with a charm all of its own – dining here makes for a really fun experience!",

First and foremost, the modern cuisine, with dishes such as gently braised shoulder of German salt meadow lamb, winter spinach from Rommerskirchen, parsley root, mirabelle plum – sophisticated and rife with flavour, but also down-to-earth and accessible. The atmosphere is suitably unpretentious, which is in no small part down to the exceptionally congenial hosts and their well-coordinated team. They may set great store by using quality produce, but the prices are really reasonable! The same goes for the wine list, especially those available by the bottle. Finally, the location in the old town between the cathedral and the Rhine means that the terrace is a place to see and be seen. Tip: Take a stroll through the old town before or after you dine.",

Top-notch ingredients are precisely prepared, down to the last detail, without the importance of flavour ever being lost from sight. This starts with the amuse-bouches (a veritable explosion of flavours!), followed, for example, by the excellent firm-fleshed, charcoal-grilled turbot from the Vendeé – which has a wonderful smoky aroma – harmoniously combined with terrific fresh black morels, fine white asparagus and a very elegant PX sherry note in the classic beurre noisette. The set menu features two intriguing wine pairings. You can also dine à la carte. Magdalena Rambichler is always on hand, cordial and extremely competent as she heads up the service team.

Alternatively, try out oifach andersch, which proposes traditional Swabian cuisine that also draws on international influences.",

You should allow plenty of time for this dinner, but an entertaining evening is assured, with the numerous intriguing small dishes emerging from the open kitchen at a good pace, as well as the competent and charming service team led by Florian Raake (who also provides excellent wine recommendations with tips such as Daniel Mattern's Hop & Grape). This place is somewhat tucked away in a courtyard, where owner Robin Pietsch also has his second restaurant, Pietsch.",

In an idyllic setting, Daniel Schmidthaler serves up an exciting and modern surprise menu comprising five or seven courses in the \"Klassenzimmer\" where pupils once studied. The menu changes daily thanks to a constant supply of ever-changing ingredients, freshly sourced directly from the region. Wonderful vegetables and herbs, nuts and fruits, as well as fish or meat, go into complex dishes that are rich in flavour and with a harmonious balance of acidity. The chef's Austrian heritage also shines through from time to time – the apricot buns to go with the coffee are terrific! The decor is simple and stylish, with charming features such as an old tiled stove, parquet flooring and tall mullioned windows. Should you wish to stay the night, there are also bright and comfortable guestrooms. Hotel guests take their meals in the beautiful setting of the conservatory.",

With a passion and style that is all his own, Thomas Imbusch brings out the seasonal flavours through fermentation and smoking, for example, and turns out honest dishes that remain close to nature. Respect for the produce is the ethos here, with the emphasis on sustainability and small-scale producers who they know personally. To be enjoyed with organic wines or alcohol-free beverages. The \"Carte Blanche Tasting Menu\" is available in a slimmed-down version at Der Stundentisch. Head to Die Empore to dine à la carte (no reservation necessary). NB: Booking is via an online ticket-purchasing system.",

Having recently expanded his skill set and his knowledge of the Japanese culinary arts in both of Yoshizumi Nagaya's Düsseldorf restaurants, Masaru Oae now proposes two omakase menus composed of seven or nine courses – one with fish/meat, one vegetarian. The quality of the ingredients is second to none. Dishes such as scallops, kale, dashi butter sauce, as well as the excellent sushi, successfully draw on both classic and modern Japanese cuisine, while remaining open to the odd European influence. The aesthetics of the food have a major part to play too, as demonstrated by the elaborately decorated medley of starters. In an unpretentious and pared-back setting that evokes the Far East, diners take their seats at small tables or at the food counter (where they can watch the chef at work). Top tip: Opt for the sake pairings served with the set menu.",

And in between, for example, \"Red prawn, onion, cantaloupe, pata negra\" or \"Azores squid, egg yolk, guanciale, Pecorino\" – interesting combinations that do full justice to the menu name \"Emotion\"!

The name (Swedish for \"field\") is a nod to the Nordic roots of head chef Björn Swanson and the ingredient-led style of cooking cultivated here by him and his team. The modern, creative set menu is completely vegetarian and comprises six courses – if you prefer not to go without fish or meat, it is possible to order up to three additional courses. You can watch the chefs at work, as the kitchen is practically part of the dining area in this friendly, vibrant little establishment – perfect for a cosy get-together.",

Situated on the top floor of the Kameha Grand lifestyle hotel, thanks to its floor-to-ceiling windows the restaurant affords a fantastic view of the Rhine – a view which is of course even better from the terrace. Then there is the smart, high-quality decor, all done out in red, black and white, as well as the experienced and well-coordinated front-of-house team. Head chef Christian Sturm-Willms delivers a highly contemporary take on Japanese cuisine that also looks to the Mediterranean for inspiration. Opt for the omakase menu if you want to be surprised. Alternatively, choose from the Ōsentikku set menu or the \"Filet & Roastbeef\" (Kobe beef).",

Japanese influences make themselves felt in dishes such as the smooth marron crayfish \"à la nage\", the succulent and tender meat of which is lent just the right degree of spiciness by Japanese mustard and harmonised brilliantly with the fantastic fine Kyoto miso sauce. Excellent ingredients are at the core of the menu. The well-curated German and international wine list counts over 1 000 different labels, and the wine pairing for the set menu is interesting. The service is everything you would hope for: charming, professional and responsive. In the L.A. Jordan Lounge, choose from the long list of à la carte dishes on the board.",

Executive chef Timo Fritsche and head chef Maximilian Huber are in tune with the times, sourcing their ingredients locally and using them in their entirety. They also do their own fermenting and pickling. In their creative set menu, they combine, for example, a perfectly cooked, wonderfully tender salmon trout from Schliersee with a full-bodied hay beurre blanc rounded off with tarragon butter and delicately seasoned, resulting in an intensively flavoured dish.

Complemented by poached egg yolk, edamame and spring onions, this culinary creation is full-bodied and packed with flavour. Pairings (wine or alcohol-free) are available on request.

Out front is a lovely terrace shielded from the street by a fence covered in plants. Inside, a blend of old and new makes for an attractive setting: old wooden panelling meets chic modern design – the mural by Jim Avignon is a focal point, as is the glass-fronted kitchen. Here, Sebastian Frank conjures up dishes rooted in the culinary traditions of his Austrian homeland with plenty of creativity and an emphasis on sustainability. He uses high-quality ingredients – sourced from the Berlin-Brandenburg region where possible – to produce pared-down dishes, often giving pride of place to vegetables. The almost unspectacular manner in which he sometimes does this is perhaps what makes it so remarkable. With great skill, he finds a way to incorporate his favourite flavours, caraway and celery, again and again. Diners can also look forward to friendly, competent service and interesting wine recommendations.",

Notable examples include the exquisite Japanese hamachi with its extremely thin miso-ponzu coating or the succulent, tender saddle of venison from Gutshof Polting, roasted to the perfect shade of pink and served with aromatic chanterelles and a buttery celeriac puree, a bold chervil beurre blanc and a glorious venison jus made with Chartreuse.

The wonderful cheese trolley deserves a mention, and the trolley of sweets and chocolates is equally enticing.

Now they operate in the Stahlbad, a beautiful 19C building and former spa hotel in the centre of Baden-Baden, and also previously home to a Michelin-starred restaurant. A delightful ground-level conservatory affords views of the verdant surroundings and converts into a covered terrace in summer. The classic French cuisine by the chef-patron, a native Frenchman, is as much in great demand as it ever was. The dishes are ingredient-led, clearly structured and wonderfully harmonious. The front-of-house team, which includes the proprietress, is exceptionally cordial and accomplished, and the wine recommendations are second to none – the available selection is excellent.

The friendly front-of-house team provides enjoyably unobtrusive service, while the sommelier helps with the wine selection. Incidentally, the Japanese name \"TAWA YAMA\" means \"tower mountain\" – a reference to the Turmberg outside Karlsruhe, which you can look out onto from the pleasant terrace. In addition to FINE, there is the trendy EASY. On a practical note: you can use the private parking garage free of charge.",

    "description": "\"Nordic Fusion\" is the name of the game in the fine dining restaurant of the luxurious BUDERSAND Hotel - Golf & Spa. Chef Felix Gabel adheres to this guiding principle as he whisks you off on a creative culinary adventure. He uses select local produce and draws on influences from around the globe, skilfully incorporating a host of different spices and flavours. A choice of two set menus is proposed (\"Große Aromenreise\" and the vegetarian \"Kraut & Rüben\"). In keeping with the cuisine, the modern decor has a distinct Nordic charm. And then there is the stunning view of the North Sea afforded by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Of course, this establishment's wonderful location on the southernmost tip of Sylt means that the terrace is a real highlight!",

In that regard, nothing has changed to this day, because this enchanting restaurant is now owned by the Brogsitter family, who can look back on a long tradition of winemaking. Following the devastating flood of summer 2021, the restaurant has been lavishly and tastefully refurbished: the interior is chic and elegant, with a high gabled ceiling and a spectacular Murano chandelier. There is also a lovely terrace. The cuisine here is classic in its foundations and draws on modern and international influences. A set menu comprising four to six courses is proposed, including dishes such as baked mahi mahi served with a pineapple compote and a shellfish and coconut nage. The wine list is extensive, with a good selection of wines available by the glass, including some from the restaurant's own winery. Friendly and professional service.",

    "description": "This stunning historical half-timbered house in the beautiful old town is home to the Boutique Hotel Pfauen and its fine dining restaurant. Chef-patron Nico Burkhardt draws on his own personal style, taking a modern and delicate approach to preparing a set menu that is replete with details and prepared using excellent ingredients; a case in point would be the wonderfully tender fillet of veal with a vanilla vinegar jus – the marriage of sweetness and acidity in the sauce is wonderful! What particularly stands out is his precise technical skill, attention to detail and the enormous effort that goes into his cooking. The food is served in an inviting and tastefully decorated space with just eight seats. Thanks to the pleasantly intimate atmosphere and attentive, cordial service, you really feel at home here.",

The two set menus, \"Vegan\" and \"Nicht vegan\", comprise six or nine flavoursome courses made using excellent ingredients. \"Taste the Waste – Some sexy stuff\", for example, demonstrates the restaurant's commitment to sustainability. With a variety of components it contributes to waste reduction and presents \"leftovers\" in a sophisticated culinary way. Some 80% of the produce is sourced from the region. Fermented foods, soy sauces, garums and kombuchas are all produced on site, along with extracts and juices. Food is served at counter seats right next to the open kitchen, or you can opt for a standard table.",

Owner Fritz Keller is fully supportive of chef Christian Baur's bid to continue cooking in the classic French style that is synonymous with the legendary Schwarzer Adler.

This cosy, stylish and elegant restaurant will go down well with wine lovers due to a sensational wine list that includes an impressive range of Bordeaux vintages.

Nestled amid the peaks of the Allgäu Alps, the premises can only be accessed via a private road – the view is breathtaking! The small restaurant is where Simon Schlachter wins diners over with a modern and creative dining concept, which aims to offer a shared experience. He achieves this with a set menu whose courses each consist of several small dishes and are perfect for sharing. Up to 18 dishes full of different components and flavours – this reflects his own elaborate style and creates a sense of complexity. To complete the picture, there is the upscale decor and professional service courtesy of the charming maître d', who happens to be the chef's partner. Alternatively, try out Restaurant 1250 with its regional cuisine (also at lunchtime).",

Diners in Hotel Lago's fine dining restaurant are bowled over not only by the view but also by the interior with its warm wood and maritime colours, high-quality furnishings and elegant Nordic design. In summer, guests can make the most of the terrace with its lounge and small sandy beach; in winter, the wood-burning stove makes for a cosy atmosphere. The focus lies squarely on the modern culinary creations of owner Klaus Buderath (he was responsible for the MICHELIN-starred cuisine at Landgasthof Adler in Rammingen and also won a star for the restaurant Lago) and head chef Benedikt Wittek. Using top-quality ingredients, the dishes are meticulously prepared with a real eye for detail. Top tip: Try the non-alcoholic drink pairings!",

Your friendly hosts are Gerd and Silke Windhösel, who ply their trade with a great sense of dedication. At the helm in the kitchen, Gerd Windhösel makes a point of using only the freshest ingredients when creating his dishes. The chef-patron also prefers to source everything from the surrounding area – from the local pasture-raised lamb to the Seckach trout and even the saffron. This is classic seasonal cuisine of the highest standard; it demonstrates a pleasingly straightforward style that steers clear of unnecessary frills while maintaining a sense of tradition. There is a choice of different set menus, including a vegetarian one, as well as a range of \"Hirsch classics\" available à la carte.",

After opening this place in 1991, he remained at the helm, steadily building it up to become a benchmark for classical fine dining at the highest level. Upholding the tradition of the establishment is his son Alexander, as maître d'. A newly assembled and highly motivated kitchen team is sticking to the restaurant's tried-and-tested formula: classic cuisine with modern touches made with excellent ingredients – the turbot with smoked eel lardo bacon and a beurre blanc sauce is a shining example. Opt for one of the set menus or order from the à la carte selection, which includes Winkler's own legendary specialities – these are as much of a draw for diners as the elegant Venetian-style setting. The wine list is impressive and Alexander Winkler's recommendations are spot on. Friendly service.",

The restaurant's unique concept allows for plenty of choice, with a four- to six-course set menu and gourmet dishes à la carte.

One such creation is the Königsberger Klopse (meatballs) with crispy sweetbreads, caper cream, Amalfi lemon, green vegetables and potato purée. \"Oma's Schokoladenpudding\" (grandma's chocolate pudding) is a tempting dessert option. The waitstaff are very friendly and laid-back, not to mention attentive. Impressive wine list including a few rare finds.

    "description": "This restaurant housed in the Hotel Schwarzwälder Hof in Freiburg's old town boasts a relaxed atmosphere and food that is by no means run-of-the-mill. The seven-course set menu on offer (which can be extended by a further two courses) steers clear of luxury ingredients, focusing instead on supposedly simpler, but high-quality and strictly regional produce that clearly reflects their philosophy of sustainability. This results in a plethora of highly interesting and innovative flavour combinations, such as fermented kohlrabi that has been cooked in salt dough served on a delicate kohlrabi tartare and finished with a bay leaf and apple stock, a pleasingly tart elderberry and caper vinaigrette and a sweet apricot ragout. The chefs themselves serve the dishes, talking diners through each course and providing information about the local producers of the select ingredients.",

Eike Iken, previously sous-chef at Votum, has fulfilled his dream of striking out on his own together with partner and restaurant manager Monique Lingg. While the owner and head chef successfully combines a modern take on classic French fare with Nordic influences (eg his terrific hand-dived scallop, almond, caviar, seaweed), you can sit back and enjoy the friendly and professional service. The chefs themselves also head out to the restaurant floor to explain the dishes. A six-course set menu is served, with three supplementary courses also on offer. Selected wine accompaniment. With just 12 tables, this small restaurant has a friendly, almost intimate atmosphere that makes you feel at home. Tip: Be sure to make a reservation!",

The chef cooks up classic cuisine using seasonal ingredients and drawing on Mediterranean and Asian influences; front of house, the cordial proprietress wins over diners with her easy Tyrolean charm. Punchy, elegant dishes made from top-notch ingredients (eg tender and aromatic slow-cooked Wagyu beef saddle with a robust jus full of depth and delicate sweetness) are accompanied by a great wine list with an emphasis on regional labels – there is even Grüner Veltliner from the restaurant's own vineyard, a nod to the hostess's Austrian roots. The glass-walled cube commands a wonderful view of the famous Trittenheimer Apotheke vineyard on the other side of the Moselle. In the pretty garden there is a marvellous terrace. Tasteful little boutique hotel next door.",

With careful consideration and a deft touch, he marries, for example, a butter-soft piece of Soonwald venison loin with beetroot baked on sea salt, black walnut and cold-stirred cranberries, as well as an aromatic jus. A few heirloom vegetables are grown in the restaurant's own garden. Tip: the beautifully landscaped roof terrace!

Federico Campolattano serves up delicious dishes that are scrupulously ingredient-led, pleasingly pared down to the essentials, and rife with beautifully balanced contrasting flavours. Diners choose between a set menu comprising five, six or nine courses and à la carte options. One of the signature dishes bears the intriguing name \"Octopus and its Neapolitan History\". The cheese menu featuring five Parmesans of varying ripeness is also an interesting experience. The wine list is predominantly Italian. Housed in a historical building in a spruce residential area of Freiburg, this restaurant is sleek and rather simple, but no less cosy for it. There is also a delightful small terrace.

    "description": "\"Bistro\" may not accurately capture the essence of the restaurant – the name dates back to an earlier era. Tucked away in Schwabing's Amalienpassage, this establishment exudes an understated elegance, and the culinary standards are just as exceptional as the exquisite setting. Owner Jürgen Wolfsgruber and his team offer a wonderfully relaxed dining experience with well-thought-out, sophisticated cuisine. For instance, dishes such as Mondseeland Maibock, kohlrabi oil, gooseberry, chanterelle are by no means playful; instead, they focus on expressing the intensity of the flavours to the full. The chef's predilection for ingredients sourced from his Austrian homeland is also clear to see. Furthermore, his passion for wine is apparent as he enjoys joining his attentive and experienced service team in providing interesting recommendations.",

The single set menu is bursting with bold flavours and demonstrates meticulous craftsmanship. Head chef Felix Weber champions a modern style of cooking and insists on the finest ingredients. The succulent turbot is grilled and then baked in the oven until slightly translucent – with its fine seasoning and wonderfully firm bite, it works beautifully with the delicate, nutty cashew cream, aromatic black salsify puree, cauliflower salad and confit kombu seaweed. Razor-thin slices of Buddha's hand and a thick, intensely flavoursome beurre blanc provide the finishing touches. Service comes courtesy of friendly and professional waitstaff. Sommelier Christian Pufahl has some interesting wine recommendations but also introduces fantastic non-alcoholic pairings with beverages he prepares himself.

For example, the excellent thick black cod is grilled over Binchotan charcoal to the exact point of becoming pearlescent, marinated with spices tableside and placed on a slice of lukewarm calf's head with a hint of Meaux mustard. Served with a fresh lettuce jus with a mild acidity and aromatic, creamy lettuce chutney with the slight heat of ginger.

He gives free rein to his inspiration with surprise set menus packed with premium ingredients: pigeon, lobster, field tomatoes, which he makes the most of in his balanced and harmonious dishes. The cheese platter, with its 50 or so types, deserves a special mention.",

Cha-kaiseki actually refers to the meal that is served with this beverage, while Yuichiro Akiyoshi is the chef’s name. Tucked away behind a suitably low-profile wooden façade, the omakase might include amberjack with ponzu jelly, tempura with grey shrimp bouillon, seabream marinated in a mix of sake, mirin and soy sauce and grilled over charcoal, sushi of mackerel, grilled salmon rice, miso soup with artichoke. Recipes that allow the super-fresh ingredients to sing, prepared in front of the client, assisted by his kimono-clad spouse. Each dish is an exquisite blend of colour and flavour, of visual artistry and zen spirituality. An exclusive, timeless experience in an interior inspired by authentic Japanese teahouses (seats only 16).",

Grounds overlooking the Var hinterland, the Mediterranean on the horizon, ponds, lavender beds… and a superb take on the cuisine of the South of France. Former sous-chef to Christophe Bacquié, Fabien Ferré is working his magic. He has an artist's sensitivity to Mediterranean produce, calling to mind Matisse, who was captivated by the light of Provence. He cooks up a high-calibre storm with two tasting menus – one vegetable-based, the other showcasing fish/seafood, which features dishes such as prawn carabineros with Meyer lemon and coral sauce, or squid with marjoram. His refined and virtuoso cuisine elevates the natural flavour of the ingredients, bolstered by memorably full-bodied sauces, a case in point being the aloe vera-scented vinaigrette that accompanies the mackerel fillet. As for desserts, pastry chef François Luciano delivers fresh and light seasonal creations, for example grapefruit with meadowsweet and Brousse du Rove goat's cheese. It is arguably worth the trip here just for the cheese cellar. Plus a terrific selection of wines and a heavenly terrace for an aperitif and coffee.",

After working in the kitchens of La Tour d'Argent and Marc Meneau's restaurant in Vézelay, the chef returned, driven by his strong sense of heritage and unwavering standards. His cooking showcases quality seasonal produce like this John Dory, marinated and precisely cooked, with green asparagus, young broad beans and fresh peas.",

Today, he continues to deliver, in a luxurious decor that embodies the quintessence of French art de vivre. A big fan of Brittany, he is a true artist when it comes to combining surf and turf elements in uninhibited yet rigorous cuisine featuring bold marriages of flavours. The \"surprise\" set menu comes with a savvy series of \"satellite\" dishes all on the same theme (eg red mullet with beef marrow and sea urchin) and draws on wide-ranging influences – from Italy and Corsica to Japan. The wine list is enough to make your head spin; one of its two sections is devoted to the owner's prestigious wines. Ask to visit the attractive vaulted cellar that houses them.",

The magical retractable sliding roof, which bathes the tables in natural light, is another highlight of this mythical venue.

When it is time for cheese, you will discover a cheese bar opposite the restaurant with a buffet of some twenty different cheeses, a range of beverages, preserves and dried fruit.",

A true artist of a chef who is in perpetual motion, he elevates the small-portion format to the realm of art; he is a virtuoso when it comes to spices, roasting and smoking; his childhood memories of the Congo flow through his cuisine. In his hands, the gastronomic mould as we know it has been broken, but, more importantly, it all makes sense! Take, for instance, his trout roe and wild salmon with smoked milk and roasted hazelnuts – in which the intensity of flavour is second to none – or the breaded langoustines with sesame seeds and bonito, a lemon-geranium condiment and seaweed popcorn – a pure wonder. At each sitting, the lucky few are whisked away on a unique adventure of taste sensations, enhanced by perfect service.",

Originally hailing from a small village between the Basque Country and Rioja, she extends a warm welcome with a charming Spanish accent. In this rural setting, the pair share a philosophy of eco-responsibility: they promote sustainable agriculture in the village by working with carefully selected producers, and even use biodegradable containers. The six- or eight-course surprise set menu is an absolute delight, as is the excellent local bread, made with natural organic sourdough.",

Slick, seamless service – 10 out of 10!",

It owes its success to Christophe Dupouy, who learned the ropes in prestigious houses ranging from Ducasse to Michel Sarran. A champion of nature and local produce, his food shines the spotlight on southwest France (particularly the Landes), with dishes like slow-cooked secreto of pork, finished in hot embers. His wife Eugénie seamlessly supervises the front-of-house team with a maitre d’ and a sommelier; the latter delves into a stonking wine bin that boasts some 600 references.",

After over 40 years of loyal service, Patrick Bertron has passed the baton to his right-hand man Louis-Philippe Vigilant. There is no doubt that the restaurant will retain the culinary signature of authenticity that sealed its reputation. As an alternative to the chef's new creations, nostalgic guests can travel back in time with some of Bernard Loiseau’s great classics, such as frog's legs with garlic purée and parsley juice, or pan-fried pike-perch in red wine sauce.",

    "description": "In an interior dominated by a masterful charcoal work, an \"urban cave painting\" depicting a bestiary by the artist Adel Abdessemed, Pierre Gagnaire continues to finetune France’s culinary scene with his adventurous, wholehearted and excessive signature cuisine. This fan of jazz and contemporary art never rests on his laurels. Gagnaire's restaurant, which has had three stars since 1996, reflects his character: modern, understated and subtly sophisticated, all of which is in perfect harmony with the attentive, delicate service. The poetic dishes are constantly reinvented, like small \"satellite\" portions sent into orbit by the chef, making it impossible to cite a single emblematic dish, or even a main characteristic – other than sheer excellence!",

He includes the best Mediterranean fish on his menu, alongside ingredients such as pine honey, saffron and snails from the Savoie, as well as vegetables sourced from Éric Roy in Tours.

Simplicity and nature are the hallmarks of the chef's cooking, and he loves to work with plants (eg hyssop, verbena etc) and vegetables sourced from local producers. When it comes to cooking and seasoning, precision is the order of the day, as characterised by the Breton lobster, strawberry, snow peas and a light bisque.

As you sample a single tasting menu, you will discover subtle, precise cuisine that carefully crafts culinary ties between Japan and France. The seasonings, cooking, carving, cutting, slicing and chopping are all at the service of the main ingredient, which is presented as simply and as artfully as possible. Sashimi, Brittany lobster, chateaubriand steak or sweetbread, cooked on the teppanyaki griddle, and served with fine Burgundy wines, painstakingly selected by the chef.

The chef's passion for herbs and roots from the surrounding mountains is more pronounced than ever; these sit alongside the fruit, vegetables and flowers from the kitchen garden in the dishes. His cuisine is also an ode to freshwater fish. Finally, let's not forget the comfortable guestrooms on offer – ideal should you wish to stay a little longer.",

Like all genuine Japanese chefs, his flair for precision and balance (plating, cooking and flavour) is second to none, and his dishes are also sprinkled with tributes to the region, such as pinot noir or vin jaune sauces and mustard shoots. The memory of his ginger-flavoured gyoza of game in a red wine sauce and his shoulder of lamb, first slow-roasted then grilled on a binchotan griddle and served with a Japanese pancake, linger with us still!

    "description": "Between Nîmes and Arles, in grounds planted with hundred-year-old cedars, Michel Kayser does what he does best: cooking from the heart to enhance the ingredients, while harnessing his technical skills in a bid to stir the emotions of good food lovers. There are few chefs who celebrate the Mediterranean with such precision, aplomb or enthusiasm: red mullet grilled under a salamander, ravioles of French olives (picholines), jus of roasted fish bones; breast of squab from Costière cooked on the bone, stuffed leg and crunchy offal, gutsy jus of smoked paprika. All the side dishes and other edible delicacies (like the bread made with red mullet scales – just the ticket to unashamedly mop up the big-boned jus in the fashion of a bouillabaisse rouille) are exclusively designed to underscore and enhance the main ingredient (which is used from top to tail, like the rabbit terrine). Utterly free of gadgets and gimmicks, everything tastes of something in this establishment devoted to flavour.",

His inspiration comes to the forefront in sauces and jus, such as a seaweed cream paired with a lightly seared fillet of John Dory, or a Grand Veneur game sauce that flanks a medallion of wild boar. A festival of flavours that is beautifully paired with a splendid selection of Alsace wines (grands crus, organic, etc).",

He successfully navigates between France (fish from the Vendée coast) and Brazil, always with a focus on outstanding produce. Meals are served in a cosy, smart interior, which sports an open kitchen, where you can admire the artist chef at work. His visually sophisticated and minimalist dishes cleverly play with contrasting flavours (sweet, spicy, acidic) and textures, without ever falling foul of the flaw of showing off! You can trust the insights of the gifted sommelier for his wine pairing suggestions. Exquisitely personal, artfully curated and divinely flavoursome – classy! Love at first bite!",

Installed in the centre of Lannion, he rustles up modern Gallic fare, dotted with Japanese overtones, in tribute to his avowed passion for the Land of the Rising Sun. as a result, some of his high-precision recipes, based on super-fresh Brittany produce (langoustine, lobster, John Dory), are sprinkled with Japanese ingredients such as yuzu, shiitake, miso, etc. Lashings of imagination, art-directed plating, stylish elegance and high-flying technique complete this culinary score. Let’s not forget the warm, colourful interior.",

For example, line-caught hake from Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Pyrenean trout gravlax, broad beans and wild garlic in a big-boned pesto and citrus juice with concentrated honey.

The establishment first saw the light of day in 1912 and the cheerful banter of the old Paris market hall seems to echo still. Initially a Lyon-styled bistro, it was run by three generations of the Petit family, who nurtured its vintage charm and its woodwork, copper pots, mirrors, velvet banquettes and closely packed tables all reek of Belle Époque Paris. Everything down to the plates bears the B monogram, further adding to the authenticity of this bistro that is light years from the trendy boltholes of today. When the business changed hands and became part of the Ducasse Group in 2005, it lost none of its old-fashioned atmosphere. Proudly and heartily traditional, the recipes feature country produce that is expertly and generously cooked. The menu reads like a turn-of-the-20C cookbook, rich in perennial favourites that you practically never get to taste anymore… except here!",

Since it was established in 1882 (between Sélestat and Riquewihr), the restaurant has made a name for itself thanks to its matelote with riesling and dishes based on local game. Marc Haeberlin, grandson of the founders, now serves the classical repertoire (foie gras terrine served by the spoonful, frog’s leg mousseline, salmon soufflé) alongside more modern creations.

    "description": "Imagine a contemporary vessel built out of stone, iron and glass set in a medieval fortress with a 360° view of the countryside. Marie-Aude and Serge Vieira fell in love with the spot and quickly turned this out-of-the-ordinary venue into an establishment whose reputation extends far beyond the borders of Auvergne. Serge, whose talent and kindness were beloved of all, bequeathed his substantial culinary heritage to Marie-Aude and her teams, all of whom are committed to upholding Serge’s enthusiastic and sensitive approach to food while enhancing the outstanding produce of Auvergne. An example: slab of Aubrac beef, courgette cannelloni and marigold-flavoured mash, black garlic and an ivy-flavoured gravy.",

In addition to his signature “artichoke” recipe, which won a prize at the 2019 Bocuse d’Or competition, he crafts dishes that keep pace with market availability and his inspiration: roasted scallops, Jerusalem artichoke and truffles; turbot in a Tom Yam sauce; squab and duck foie gras pie… The other secret of this contemporary-styled establishment is its exquisite leafy patio in the back garden.",

The Brasserie du Fantin serves a bargain priced lunchtime menu, which is a hit with the regulars, as is the summer terrace.",

The venue is the HQ of virtuoso Stéphane Tournié, with stints at Lucien Vanel in Toulouse, André Daguin in Auch, Taillevent under Philippe Legendre and the Crillon under Christian Constant. We love his knack of getting straight to the point, illustrated by wild pollock and spicy stock of langoustine or duck smoked in grass and herbs from the sweet-scented scrubland. The dishes are often finished tableside by the slick kitchen team, adding a touch of excitement to the meal.",

The chef's cuisine is modern, but not obsessed with fashion, and his dishes are clear and delicious, with lovely sauces such as the one accompanying the Racan pigeon with beetroot in a salt crust, blackcurrant and rose geranium.",
